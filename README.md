# BookStore
Bookstore uses a fraction of the Amazon database to exemplify the use of several data structures such as Queues, Lists, HashTables, BinarySearch Trees, Heaps, Graphs and sorting. The program allows adding books to a shopping cart.

This project is organized in different files (modules)
- main.py: The main entry point of the program. It will present the menu that executes the other modules
- BookStore.py: The book store system 
- Book.py: Data class that holds the attributes of a book. The class allows to compare ranks using the operator < or >
- SortableBook.py: Data class that holds the attributes of a book. The class allows to compare by alphabetical order using the operator < or >
- Interfaces.py: The interfaces to be implemented: Stack, Queue, Deque, List, Set, Graph
- ArraStack.py: It will implement the interface Stack 
- ArraQueue.py: It will implement the interface Queue 
- ArraList.py: It will implement the interface List 
- ArraDeque.py: It implements the interface Deque. It is a specialization (Inheritance) of ArrayList
- RandomQueue.py: It will implement the interface Queue. It is a specialization (Inheritance) of ArrayQueue
- MaxQueue.py: It will implement the interface Queue. It is a specialization (Inheritance) of ArrayQueue. 
- SLLStack.py: It will implement the interface Stack 
- SLLQueue.py: It will implement the interface Queue 
- DLList.py: It will implement the interface List 
- DLLDeque.py: It implements the interface Deque. It is a specialization (Inheritance) of DLLList
- ChainedHashTable.py: It will implement the interface USet 
- BinarySearchTree.py: It will implement the interface Sorted Set 
- BinaryHeap.py: It will implement the interface Queue. It removes the element with highest priority
- algorithms.py: It will implement the sorting algorithms
- AdjacencyList.py: It will implement the Graph interface using the adjencency list
- AdjacencyMatrix.py: It will implement the Graph interface using the adjacency matrix
